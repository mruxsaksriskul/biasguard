# 🛡️BiasGuard (BG) 🚨

**BiasGuard is an AI policy enforcement framework for generative AI (GenAI) and agentic systems**, enabling compliance-as-code practices across model development, deployment, and operations. Built to address emerging concerns in transparency, attribution, and fairness, BiasGuard provides a modular rules engine to codify bias detection, attribution enforcement, and explainability checks directly into MLOps and CI/CD workflows.

Inspired by tools like CloudFormation Guard and Open Policy Agent (OPA), BiasGuard is designed to work across cloud-native ecosystems and support both automated pipelines and runtime policy enforcement.

You’ve seen the signs:
- *The lawyer citing fake ChatGPT cases in court*
- *Dragnet-style LLM scraping* without attribution
- *Silent model-to-model calls* with no audit trail or disclosure

**BiasGuard is the compliance layer for AI we urgently need.**

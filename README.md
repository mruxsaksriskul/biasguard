BiasGuard is an AI policy enforcement framework built to make AI systems accountable, auditable, and aligned with ethical and legal standards from the start. By integrating into modern AI/ML pipelines, BiasGuard provides codified bias prevention, transparency, and compliance through an open-core engine.

## What is BiasGuard?

*Explain Like I'm 6:*  
BiasGuard is like a superhero for AI â€” it helps catch and prevent biases before they cause problems!

## Integration

BiasGuard integrates seamlessly with modern development workflows using GitHub Actions. Our current integration supports API-driven connections to platforms like AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, and Apigee.

This integration ensures that policy enforcement is automated and consistent, providing real-time feedback as rules are applied through your CI/CD pipelines.

## Workflow

The contribution and enforcement process is streamlined using GitHub Actions:

- **Rule Submission:** Contributors submit new rules via pull requests.
- **Validation:** Automated linting and validation ensure consistency.
- **Enforcement:** The system deploys the rules into production environments, demonstrated by our CI/CD workflows.
